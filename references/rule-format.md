# Rule format that rules_check.py reads

A rule is any list item or paragraph containing a directive word (must, never, always, do not, don't,
forbidden, required, prohibited, refuse; 必须, 不许, 禁止, 一律, 绝不, 不得). Tags are searched inside
the same block (the item plus its indented continuation lines):

```markdown
- Never push while the branch is behind origin.
  Incident: 2026-07-11 a stale local build was deployed over work that only existed on the remote.
  Enforced by: hooks/guardrail.py
- Data-file edits must keep the file's indentation.
  Why: 2026-08-19 a one-line edit re-indented a 600 KB file; the diff became unreadable.
  Enforced by: python3 tools/indent_guard.py
```

`Enforced by:` accepts a path (relative to the rules file's directory or `--base`) or a command. With
`--run`, `.py/.sh/.mjs` targets are executed with the matching interpreter and must exit 0.

Converting a prohibition into a step:

| Prohibition | Default action that produces it | Checkable step + trigger |
|---|---|---|
| never simplify the analysis | writing compresses | end-of-procedure coverage check: every old heading accounted for |
| never `git add -A` | habit | PreToolUse hook denies and prints `git add -- <paths>` |
| never trust "tests pass" | accepting a claim | evidence bundle + independent audit before the claim is acted on |
| don't guess contact e-mails | filling a table quickly | each address has a source URL opened and quoted |
