# nk-rules-that-land

![nk-rules-that-land](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NickkkLian/nickkk-skills/main/gallery/social/nk-rules-that-land.png)

An agent skill for [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) and [OpenAI Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex). Write rules for an AI agent that actually change what it does.

Part of [nickkk-skills](https://github.com/NickkkLian/nickkk-skills) — skills that stop an AI coding agent's
"done, tested, safe" from being taken on faith.

## What it does

- Three tests: names its incident · enforced by something that exists and runs · a checkable step where the default action happens, not a prohibition.
- `scripts/rules_check.py CLAUDE.md [--run]` audits a rules file: NO-INCIDENT, NO-ENFORCEMENT, MISSING-TARGET, FAILED-RUN, OVERFIT.
- What to do when the same mistake repeats with the rule in place, and when the rule list keeps growing.

The full procedure, the boundaries and where the rules came from are in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md).

## How it works

1. It names its incident
2. It is enforced by something that exists and runs
3. It is a positive, checkable step at the point where the default happens

## Install

Pick one of four ways: three for Claude Code, one for OpenAI Codex. Skills load when a session starts, so open a **new** session after installing.

### 1 · Terminal, one command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NickkkLian/nk-rules-that-land ~/.claude/skills/nk-rules-that-land
```

1. Run the command above (for one project only, clone into `.claude/skills/nk-rules-that-land` inside that project).
2. Start a new Claude Code session.
3. Check it loaded: type `/nk-rules-that-land` — it appears in the slash-command menu. Or just ask for the task; the skill triggers on its own.

### 2 · Claude Code in a terminal session (plugin)

The plugin route goes through the [nickkk-skills](https://github.com/NickkkLian/nickkk-skills) marketplace. Add it once; after that each skill is one command.

```
/plugin marketplace add NickkkLian/nickkk-skills
/plugin install nk-rules-that-land@nickkk-skills
```

1. In a Claude Code session, run the first line (once per machine).
2. Run the second line.
3. Start a new session (or run `/reload-plugins`). The skill shows up as `nk-rules-that-land:nk-rules-that-land`.

Without opening a session, the same two steps work from a shell: `claude plugin marketplace add NickkkLian/nickkk-skills` then `claude plugin install nk-rules-that-land@nickkk-skills`.

### 3 · Claude desktop app (Code tab)

**Add the marketplace first — Discover only searches marketplaces you have already added.**

<sub>Recorded on 2026-09-16, when the marketplace listed ten skills, all at version 0.1.0; it lists more now. The repository list in this recording shows the recorder's own repositories because a GitHub account is connected; yours will show yours. Type the full name as in step 4.</sub>

1. In the chat box, type `/plugin marketplace` and press Enter (or open **Settings → Customize → Plugins**). The **Plugins** panel opens.

2. Top right, open **Add ▾** and choose **Add marketplace**.

3. Choose **Add from a repository**.

4. In **URL**, type the full `NickkkLian/nickkk-skills`. At the bottom of the list choose the row **Use "NickkkLian/nickkk-skills"**, then press **Sync**.

5. You land on **Discover**, filtered to the new marketplace (**Filter · 1**). Find **Nk rules that land** and press **Add**. Installed ones show **✓ Added**.

6. Close the panel and start a new session.

To try it for one session without installing anything: `claude --plugin-dir ./nk-rules-that-land` from a clone.

### 4 · OpenAI Codex CLI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NickkkLian/nk-rules-that-land.git ~/.agents/skills/nk-rules-that-land
```

1. Run the command above (for one project only, clone into `.agents/skills/nk-rules-that-land` inside that project).
2. Start a new Codex session.
3. Check it loaded, without spending a model call: `codex debug prompt-input | grep -o -- '- nk-rules-that-land[a-z0-9:-]*' | sort -u` prints `- nk-rules-that-land:nk-rules-that-land:`. Codex adds the `nk-rules-that-land:` prefix because this repository also carries a Claude Code plugin manifest. Ask for the task and the skill triggers on its own, or type `$` and pick it from the list.

## Compatibility

| Agent | Tested | What was checked |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code (CLI 2.1.173, macOS) | yes | In a fresh project with an isolated Claude config, inside a macOS sandbox that blocked reading the tester's ~/.claude folder (settings, session history, memory), Desktop, Documents and Downloads, SSH keys and git identity, a plain request that never names the skill triggered it and it ran its bundled script. The route 2 plugin commands were also run from a shell with an isolated config: marketplace add, install, list. |
| OpenAI Codex CLI (0.154.0-alpha.6.2, gpt-5.6-sol, low reasoning, macOS) | yes | Copied into `~/.agents/skills` of a temporary home (the folder route 4 clones into), in a fresh project, without the user's Codex config. From a plain request that never names the skill, Codex read SKILL.md, ran `scripts/rules_check.py --run` on the rules file (3 directives, none with an incident or an enforcement) and said what each rule needs to actually stop an agent. |
| Cursor, Gemini CLI | no | Not tested. Their documentation says both read `~/.agents/skills`, the folder route 4 clones into; Gemini CLI asks before it activates a skill. |

In this skill's Codex run, every call into the skill folder's scripts/ used that folder's absolute path. Route 4 was checked for this repository: cloned from GitHub into a temporary home's `~/.agents/skills`, it was listed by the step 3 command. This skill's frontmatter uses only name, description, license and metadata.

## Verify

```bash
python3 scripts/rules_check.py --selftest
```

Standard library only, Python 3.9+. Before publishing, the guarded lines of each script were
mutated one at a time in a sandbox copy and the self-test was confirmed to go red on the named
assertion, without a traceback; the unmutated control stayed green.

## Limits

- The audit finds tags, not truth: a fake `Enforced by:` passes. `--run` catches enforcement that is broken, not enforcement that is off the path.
- Directive detection is keyword-based; a rule phrased without must/never/always is not counted.

## License

MIT. Read a script before letting it run in your environment.
