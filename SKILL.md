description: Write rules for an AI agent that actually change what it does. Use when editing CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, a system prompt or a team playbook, when the same mistake happens again with the rule already written down, or when a brief has grown a long list of must/never. Three tests for every rule — it names its incident, it is enforced by something that exists and runs, and it is a checkable step at the point where the default behaviour happens rather than a prohibition — plus scripts/rules_check.py to audit a rules file for rules that only exist on paper. Not a prompt-writing guide.

# Rules that land

**A prohibition only works at the moment someone remembers it; the mistake happens during the default
action, when nobody is remembering anything.** "Never simplify the analysis" was read at the top of every
session and violated six times in a row, because compressing is what writing does by default. It stopped
the first time the rule became a step: a coverage check at the end of the procedure that the writer had
to pass. Same for "never `git add -A`": a line in a document did nothing; a hook that denies it and prints
the replacement command did.

> **Paths.** Commands in this skill start with `${…SKILL_DIR}`: this skill's own folder, the one that contains this SKILL.md. Claude Code fills it in. If your agent shows the placeholder as written (Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI and others), replace it with that folder's absolute path before you run the command. Left as it is, it expands to nothing and the path breaks.

## Three tests for a rule

1. **It names its incident.** A rule without a dated event behind it is an imagined risk; imagined risks
   fire on normal work, and a few false alarms teach the reader to ignore all alarms. Write
   `Incident: <date> <what happened>` on the rule. If there is no incident, do not add the rule yet.
2. **It is enforced by something that exists and runs.** `Enforced by: <script or hook or checklist>`.
   A rule enforced by memory is a wish. The enforcement should live on the path the work actually takes
   (a pre-commit hook, a step in the release script, a self-test) — a gate that exists next to the path is
   the same as no gate.
3. **It is a positive, checkable step at the point where the default happens**, not a "never". Convert:
   `never X` → find the default action that produces X → add a check there that can fail → decide what
   happens when it fails (stop / ask / fix). "Never lose content when rewriting" became "after a rewrite,
   list the old headings and bold terms and account for each one".

## When the same mistake repeats

The memory was read and did not help. Do not write it down a third time; fix the procedure:
- find the step where the mistake is made (usually the default action),
- add a checkable criterion with a trigger (a checklist line, a script, a required output),
- check whether the wording of the procedure itself invites the mistake ("summarise", "table format").

## When the rules keep growing

Every correction that adds a permanent constraint shrinks the space the next attempt may use. Ten rounds
of "also never…" produced outputs that got smaller each round. Before adding a rule: retract the last
one that was about the previous attempt; if a brief carries more than a handful of must/never lines,
stop and ask what the one real objective is. `rules_check.py` flags a file with more than twelve.

## Audit a rules file

`python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/rules_check.py CLAUDE.md [--run]`
finds every directive (must / never / always / do not …) and reports:

| Finding | Meaning |
|---|---|
| NO-INCIDENT | no `Incident:` / `Why:` in the rule's block |
| NO-ENFORCEMENT | no `Enforced by:` / `gate:` / `hook:` / `check:` |
| MISSING-TARGET | the enforcement path does not exist |
| FAILED-RUN | with `--run`, the enforcement command exited non-zero |
| OVERFIT | more than twelve directives in one file |

Read the result as a to-do list: each NO-ENFORCEMENT is a rule that will be broken on a busy day.

## Writing the rule itself (form)

- One rule, one line, one reason. `Never push while behind origin. Incident: 2026-07-11 a stale build
  overwrote live work. Enforced by: hooks/guardrail.py`.
- The reason is for the reader who is about to break it, so it says what breaks.
- Put the rule where it will be seen at the moment it matters (the hook's own message, the checklist
  step), and only a pointer in the long document. One home per rule; copies drift.

## Boundaries

- The audit finds tags, not truth: a fake `Enforced by:` passes. `--run` catches enforcement that is
  broken, not enforcement that is off the path.
- Directive detection is keyword-based; a rule phrased without must/never/always is not counted.

## Provenance

Own practice, 2026-07 to 2026-09. The habit of reading published prompt-engineering advice ("write
prohibitions", "explain why") came first; the three tests above were rebuilt from what actually
changed behaviour in daily use: incident-backed rules, machine enforcement on the real path, and a
checkable step instead of a prohibition. The overfit rule came from ten rounds of shrinking outputs.
